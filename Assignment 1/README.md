# Causal Inference Project

In this project we are looking for the causal effect of two treatment on the outcomes. We use two datasets in this project. First, to evaluate the impact of high-quality childcare and home visits on the future cognitive test score of low-birth-weight premature infants, we use the Infant Health Developement Program (IHDP) which is accessible from [here](https://github.com/dmachlanski/CE888_2022/raw/main/project/data/ihdp.csv). Next, to examine the effect of job training from the National Supported Work Program (NSWP) on the employment status of the individuals we use JOBS dataset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/dmachlanski/CE888_2022/raw/main/project/data/jobs.csv). Both datasets are also available on this repository named IHDP.txt and JOBS.txt.

We use Python to capture the causal impacts of these two policy.
