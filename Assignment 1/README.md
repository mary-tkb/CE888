# Causal Inference Project

In this project we are looking for the causal effect of two treatment on the outcomes. We use two datasets in this project. First, to evaluate the impact of high-quality childcare and home visits on the future cognitive test score of low-birth-weight premature infants, we use the Infant Health Developement Program (IHDP) which is accessible from [here](https://github.com/dmachlanski/CE888_2022/raw/main/project/data/ihdp.csv). Next, to examine the effect of job training from the National Supported Work Program (NSWP) on the employment status of the individuals we use JOBS dataset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/dmachlanski/CE888_2022/raw/main/project/data/jobs.csv). Both datasets are also available on this repository named IHDP.txt and JOBS.txt.

We use Jupyter Notebook to load, clean and explore these datasets to have a better understanding of data and check whether they are unbalanced or balanced datasets, correlation between variables, summary stats and type of variables, and whether there is any missing values in the data. You can find the code in [here](https://github.com/mary-tkb/CE888/blob/main/Assignment%201/CE888%20-%20Project.ipynb)
